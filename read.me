Growing up as a young Ghanaian student and being exposed to different fields of study in the Senior high school, I developed a great passion to contribute to addressing societal economic problems in the allocation of scarce resources. This passion has been by the dire economic hardships that has plagued Ghana and other countries in the global south, characterized by high unemployment rates, low income levels, inequality in the distribution of the scarce resources and above all poverty. As a Senior High School student, I was intrigued by how basic models in mathematics were applied to solving economic problems. I was inspired by documentaries, publications and presentations that related principles such as econometrics,  and game theory, to real life situations with the aim of creating real solutions. This fueled my desire to want to pursue my first degree in a course that focused on combining mathematical models with economic theories and principles. A search for a university that offered such a program in Ghana proved futile. The programs in Ghana either focused more on economics alone with limited mathematical models, or solely focused on mathematics. This made me to resort to foreign options. 
With the help of a Ghanaian Professor at Trent University, Prof. David Firang, who has been my mentor since childhood, the Bsc. Mathematical Economics program was recommended to me, of which I applied successfully and gained admission. The program combines core courses in both mathematics and economics. As published on the trentu.ca website, the program is structured to help students “analyze, strategize, understand bargaining and auctions (game theory), make sense of complex economic data (econometrics), maximize profit and minimize costs (optimization), and augment happiness (welfare economics)”. These components of the program structure will directly help prepare me towards my career objective. A review of the profiles of the faculty members, with emphasis on inventions, publications, community works, and the overall economic state of Canada, makes Trent University a more suitable place for scholarship.
After a successful completion of this program, I am optimistic about gaining the basic requisite knowledge and skills relevant to tackle complex economic challenges facing our world. Given the current human resource gap for strategic economic planning and implementation especially in the banking and business sector in Ghana, obtaining the degree will be a fundamental step towards becoming an asset that contribute towards an improved economy in Ghana and other parts of the world. With a very strong family ties and commitment to the wellbeing of the poor in Ghana, I shall return to my home country to take up roles in business consulting firms and banking institutions for two years as an economic advisor or econometrician. I will also set up a consulting firm that focuses on community economic growth through support for small businesses.  Through this, I will gain hands-on experience in the field, and prepare me for more future roles. I will then proceed to pursue a Master of Applied Economics and Policy Analysis degree from the University of Regina, Canada, to further enhance my path towards making a more meaningful contribution to the economic development that addresses poverty and inequality through policy formulation.
